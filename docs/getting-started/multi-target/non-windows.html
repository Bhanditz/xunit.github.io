<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net</h1>
<h2>Multi-targeting with non-Windows OSes</h2>

<p>
  This article describes the process that is necessary to enable multi-platform, multi-target
  builds; specifically, it's designed for users who are attempting to enable multi-targeting
  of .NET Framework when running on Linux or macOS. It leverages the .NET SDK command line
  tool (<code>dotnet</code>) to do builds and test execution.

<p><em>
  This documentation will include links and version numbers that were valid at the time it
  was created. Newer package versions and links may become available in the future, so your
  results may be slightly different.
</em></p>

<h2 id="prereq">Pre-Requisites</h2>

<p>
  The requirements to support multi-targeting on Windows and non-Windows OSes are different.
  For Windows OSes, it is assumed that the (one and only one version) of .NET Framework will
  be installed as part of your Windows installation, so the only required step is to enable
  it. The build system for the .NET SDK already understands how to build .NET Framework
  applications on Windows, and <code>dotnet test</code> already understands how to run them.
</p>

<p>
  On non-Windows OSes, you're missing two key components: the libraries that are required to
  compile your applications, and the .NET Framework runtime. The former are added (in a somewhat
  convoluted way) through NuGet packages, and the latter comes from Mono: an open source
  implementation of the .NET Framework that's available for Linux and macOS (the other two
  officially supported platforms for the .NET SDK).
</p>

<p>
  So, in addition to installing the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">.NET SDK</a>,
  you will also need to install
  <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/">Mono</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="findpackage">Find .NET Framework Reference Package</h2>

<p>
  Unlike most NuGet packages, the process of enabling .NET Framework support for your multi-targeted
  projects is not just a matter of adding a single package. Instead, the process is split up into
  two steps: identifying the package with your libraries, and updating the <code>.csproj</code> file
  to include the directives to allow the C# compiler to find the .NET Framework reference libraries
  when building your executable.
</p>

<p>
  As of the writing of this article, these libraries (created by the .NET team at Microsoft) are housed
  on MyGet, rather than the more traditional NuGet repository. In order to find the package you want,
  you need to visit the <a href="https://dotnet.myget.org/gallery/dotnet-core">.NET Core Gallery</a>
  on MyGet and find your framework's package version.
</p>

<p>
  On the gallery page, go to the Search box and type <code>microsoft.targetingpack.netframework</code>.
  This will limit the package list to those packages that provide the reference libraries for the
  .NET Framework. Find the one that matches the version of the .NET Framework that you're targeting,
  and note it's version number. (For our example, we'll be using package
  <code>Microsoft.TargetingPack.NETFramework.v4.5.2</code> which is currently version
  <code>1.0.1</code>.)
</p>

<h2 id="updatecsproj">Updating Your .csproj File</h2>

<p>
  There are three (or four) changes to make to your <code>.csproj</code> file to enable multi-targeting,
  supporting both Windows and non-Windows machines.
</p>

<h3>Setting TargetFrameworks</h3>

<p>
  Make sure you've updated your <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</code> element to include the .NET
  Framework version you're planning to target. Note that if your project was previously single-targeting
  .NET Core, you will need to change <code>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</code> (singular) to
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</code> (plural). In our example, we're adding <code>net452</code> to
  our existing <code>netcoreapp2.1</code> test project:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>net452;netcoreapp2.1</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Adding NuGet package reference</h3>

<p>
  You will need a NuGet package reference for the .NET Framework reference libraries. You will add
  this to a conditional <code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;</code> inside your <code>.csproj</code> file. For
  our example, the item group looks like this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<ItemGroup Condition=" '$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' AND '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net452' ">
  <PackageReference
      Include="Microsoft.TargetingPack.NETFramework.v4.5.2"
      Version="1.0.1"
      ExcludeAssets="All"
      PrivateAssets="All" />
</ItemGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You will replace the exact package name and version with the one you found in the step above.
  Since the condition is gated on both non-Windows OSes as well as the specific target framework,
  you can add more of these as needed for each .NET Framework target your project includes.
</p>

<h3>Adding compiler settings to find the reference libraries</h3>

<p>
  Once we have the package downloaded, we need to inform the C# compiler where the framework
  reference assemblies live. We also need to let NuGet know where the NuGet package lives, since
  it's currently only available on MyGet. For our sample, this means adding a new
  <code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</code> element with these two values:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' AND '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net452' ">
  <FrameworkPathOverride>$(NuGetPackageRoot)microsoft.targetingpack.netframework.v4.5.2/1.0.1/lib/net452/</FrameworkPathOverride>
  <RestoreAdditionalProjectSources>https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json</RestoreAdditionalProjectSources>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Once again, you will replace your package name and version number as needed. Note that the NuGet package
  cache always stores package names in lowercase, and since non-Windows OS file systems can be case-sensitive,
  you too must use fully lowercased names.
</p>

<h3>Adding references to system libraries (as needed)</h3>

<p>
  Normally there is a batch of system libraries that automatically get referenced when building .NET
  Framework applications. You may find as you build on non-Windows OSes that you're missing some of these
  references that might otherwise have been included automatically on Windows. In our example, we were
  missing one reference:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet build</span>
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15.9.20+g88f5fadfbe for .NET Core
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Restore completed in 30.82 ms for ~/src/MyFirstUnitTests/MyFirstUnitTests.csproj.
  MyFirstUnitTests -> ~/src/MyFirstUnitTests/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/MyFirstUnitTests.dll
<span style="color: #e03030">Class1.cs(7,10): error CS0012: The type 'Attribute' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. [~/src/MyFirstUnitTests/MyFirstUnitTests.csproj]</span>
</pre>

<p>
  You can add them as <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code> elements in the <code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;</code>
  you created when adding your NuGet packages, since it already contains the conditional statement. To fix our
  error above, we needed to add one reference:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<ItemGroup Condition=" '$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' AND '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net452' ">
  <PackageReference
      Include="Microsoft.TargetingPack.NETFramework.v4.5.2"
      Version="1.0.1"
      ExcludeAssets="All"
      PrivateAssets="All" />
  <Reference Include="System.Runtime" />
</ItemGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Note that non-Windows OSes, file systems are often case sensitive, so when adding references, make sure the
  names <em>exactly</em> match the casing of the files on your file system (without the <code>.dll</code> extension).
  You can find those files in your NuGet cache folder. For our example, we found the files here:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">ls ~/.nuget/packages/microsoft.targetingpack.netframework.v4.5.2/1.0.1/lib/net452</span>
Accessibility.dll				    System.Net.NetworkInformation.dll
CustomMarshalers.dll				    System.Net.Primitives.dll
ISymWrapper.dll					    System.Net.Requests.dll
...
System.Net.dll					    WindowsBase.dll
System.Net.Http.dll				    WindowsFormsIntegration.dll
System.Net.Http.WebRequest.dll			    XamlBuildTask.dll
</pre>

<p><em>
  One file that constantly causes trouble is System.Xml. The automatically generated reference is
  for <code>System.Xml</code>, but the file on disk is named <code>System.XML.dll</code>. When you add your
  <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code>, make sure you use the properly cased name. This is one reason why verifying
  the filename on disk is critical when adding any references. It's also valuable to make sure you've tried
  your build on a case-sensitive file system (for example, using the default ext4 on Linux).
</em></p>

<h2 id="runningtests">Running Tests</h2>

<p>
  If all of these steps have been performed successfully, then your normal command line tools should all
  run successfully: <code>dotnet restore</code>, <code>dotnet build</code>, and <code>dotnet test</code>.
  Give them a try! Here are a few tips:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you run into restore errors, please make sure you've added the PropertyGroup
    and ItemGroup correctly.
  </li>
  <li>If your build fails, check the messages, as you may need to add references.</li>
  <li>
    Your tests may also fail when running on a non-Windows OS because of environmental changes, so be
    on the lookout for things related to file paths (<code>\</code> vs. <code>/</code>) and line ending
    differences (CRLF on Windows vs. LF on Linux and macOS). Make sure to use the <code>Path</code> class
    when creating and manipulating file paths, and use <code>Environment.NewLine</code> to know which
    line endings are in use. You can also pass a flag to <code>Assert.Equal</code> when comparing strings
    to tell it to ignore line ending differences
    (<code>Assert.Equal(expected, actual, ignoreLineEndingDifferences: true);</code>).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As previously mentioned, when running on non-Windows OSes, <code>dotnet test</code> knows how to launch
  your .NET Framework tests with Mono. If all goes to plan, when you run your tests, you should be able to
  successfully run your .NET Framework tests. You may even see signs of Mono in your stack traces:
</p>

<pre>
Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: 5
Actual:   4
