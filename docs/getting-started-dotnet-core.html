<h1>Getting started with xUnit.net (.NET Core / ASP.NET Core)</h1>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net and .NET Core,
  showing you how to write and run your first set of unit tests.

</ul>

<p><em>
  Note: The examples were done with xUnit.net v2.3 Beta 4, .NET Core SDK 2.0, and
  .NET Core 2.0. The version numbers, paths, and generated templates may differ for
  you, depending on which version you're using. .NET Core 1.x is also supported.
</em></p>

<h2 id="download-dotnet">Download the .NET Core SDK</h2>

<p>
  As of this writing, the .NET Core SDK is available for
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core">download</a> for Windows,
  Linux, and OS X. Once you've downloaded and installed the SDK, open a fresh
  command prompt of your choice (CMD, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) and make sure
  that you can access the CLI by typing <code>dotnet --version</code>. You
  should be rewarded with a single line, describing the version of the
  .NET Core SDK you have installed:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet --version</span>
2.0.0
</pre>

<p><em>
  Note: the first time you run the <code>dotnet</code> command, it may
  perform some post-installation steps. Once these one-time actions are done,
  it will execute your command.
</em></p>

<h2 id="create-project">Create the unit test project</h2>

<p>
  An xUnit.net test project for .NET Core, just like other xUnit.net test projects
  for .NET, starts with a class library. From the command line, create a folder
  for your test project, change into it, and then create the project:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">mkdir MyFirstUnitTests</span>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">cd MyFirstUnitTests</span>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet new classlib</span>
Content generation time: 23.3746 ms
The template "Class library" created successfully.
</pre>

<p>
  The result of this project template creates a .NET Standard class library. We
  actually want a .NET Core class library (since we're writing .NET Core tests),
  so open the generated <code>.csproj</code> file and edit it so that it looks
  like this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.3.0-beta4-build3742" />
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="dotnet-xunit" Version="2.3.0-beta4-build3742" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We've made two important changes here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We changed the target framework to <code>netcoreapp2.0</code>, which means
    that our tests will use .NET Core 2.0.x (whatever is the latest version
    installed on our machine);
  </li>
  <li>
    We added a new package reference to <code>xunit</code>, as well as a new
    .NET CLI Tool reference to <code>dotnet-xunit</code>. The former is the
    unit testing framework, and the latter is the command line tooling that
    allows you to run the unit tests.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now let's verify that everything is working:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
  Excellent! There were no unit tests to run, because we didn't write any
  yet. Let's do that now.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  When you created the project, the project template automatically created a file
  named <code>Class1.cs</code>. Using your favorite text editor, open this file
  and add a couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's go run the tests again and see what happens:</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet xunit</span>

      Actual:   4
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>
        C:\...\MyFirstUnitTests\Class1.cs(16,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 2, Errors: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.132s
</pre>

<p><em>
  Note: We didn't run <code>dotnet restore</code> this time. You only need to run that
  command when you have changed something inside the <code>.csproj</code> file, like
  package references.
</em></p>

<p>
  The .NET Core CLI test runner has several command line options, which include options for
  parallelization, test filtering, and result reporting. To learn more about the console
  runner options, run <code>dotnet xunit --help</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more
  way to write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named
  <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test.
  xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests:
  facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories,
  we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to
  test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're
  writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers
  into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm
  is wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we
  can see it fail):
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This time when we compile and run our tests, we see a second failure, for our
  theory that was given 6:
</p>

<pre>
xUnit.net Console Runner (64-bit .NET Core 4.6.00001.0)
  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
    <span style="color: #e03030">MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(value: 6) [FAIL]</span>
      Assert.True() Failure
      Expected: True
      Actual:   False
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>
        C:\...\MyFirstUnitTests\Class1.cs(30,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(Int32 value)
    <span style="color: #e03030">MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest [FAIL]</span>
      Assert.Equal() Failure
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>
        C:\...\MyFirstUnitTests\Class1.cs(16,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 5, Errors: 0, Failed: 2, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.146s
</pre>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran
  5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test.
  Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because
  it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.
</p>

<h2 id="multi-targeting">Running tests against multiple targets</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want to write tests and ensure they run against several target
  application platforms. The xUnit.net test runner that we've been using supports
  .NET Core 1.0 or later, as well as Desktop .NET 4.5.2 or later. With a single
  test project, we can have our tests run against multiple target frameworks.
  Open the <code>.csproj</code> file and change this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To this:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net452;netcoreapp2.0</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Note that in addition to adding a new target framework, we also renamed the
  element from <code>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</code> (singular) to
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</code>(plural).
</p>

<p>
  Since we changed the <code>.csproj</code> file, we need to remember to re-run
  <code>dotnet restore</code> before trying to run our unit tests. Now when
  we run the tests, you can see that it runs both target frameworks, one after
  another:
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests-visualstudio">Running tests with Visual Studio</h2>

<p class="important">
  <strong>If you're having problems discovering or running tests,</strong> you may be a victim
  of a corrupted runner cache inside Visual Studio. To clear this cache, shut down all instances
  of Visual Studio, then delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>.
  Also make sure your project is only linked against a single version of the Visual Studio runner
  NuGet package (<code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>).
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your
  xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer). Unfortunately,
  this does not include Express editions of Visual Studio (you should upgrade to the free
  <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Community
  Edition</a> instead).
</p>

<p>
  Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>.
  You will need to install two packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> (version <code>2.3.0-beta4-build3742</code> or later)</li>
  <li><code>Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk</code> (version <code>15.0.0</code> or later)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of the NuGet window:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/running-tests-in-vs/add-xunit-runner-visualstudio.png" width="981" /></p>

<p>
  Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Every
  time you build your project, the runner will discover unit tests in your project. After a moment of
  discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer.png" width="314" /></p>

<p>
  Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update
  in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="347" /></p>

<p>
  You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the
  stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.
</p>

<h2 id="console-return-codes">Console runner return codes</h2>

<p>When running tests from the command line, the following return codes are used by the runner:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Return code</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">The tests ran successfully.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">One or more of the tests failed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>2</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      The help page was shown, either because it was requested, or because the user did not provide any
      command line arguments.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>3</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem with one of the command line options passed to the runner.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>4</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem loading one or more of the test assemblies (for example, if a 64-bit only assembly
      is run with the 32-bit test runner).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
