<div class="note">
  <p>Note: Specific versions of xUnit.net only support specific versions of .NET CLI.</p>
  <p>The version compatibility list is:</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>dotnet --version</th>
        <th>xunit packages</th>
        <th>dotnet-test-xunit package</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>1.0.0-preview1-002702</td>
        <td><code>2.1.0</code></td>

  <p>
    To run tests from the current folder, type <code>dotnet test</code>; to run tests
    from an arbitrary folder, type <code>dotnet test <em>folder</em></code>. You can
    pass command line options to these commands; type <code>dotnet test -help</code>
    for a full list of supported commands.
  </p>
  The examples shown here are done with xUnit.net 2.2 Beta 2, xUnit.net .NET CLI
  runner 2.2 Preview 2, and .NET CLI 1.0 Preview 2 (including .NET Core 1.0 RTM).
  <em>Attempting to use any version of .NET CLI other than the supported version will
  result in indeterminate behavior, and is not officially supported.</em>

<h2 id="create-class-library">Create a class library project</h2>

<p>
  Let's start by creating a .NET Core Class Library application. Open Visual Studio, and
  choose <code>File &gt; New &gt; Project</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-dotnet-core/new-project.png" width="789" /></p>

<h2 id="add-xunit-ref">Add a reference to xUnit.net</h2>

<p>In Solution Explorer, find and open the <code>project.json</code> file:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-dotnet-core/open-project-json.png" width="297" /></p>

<p>Replace the contents of your project.json file with the ones listed below:</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "version": "1.0.0-*",
    "testRunner": "xunit",
    "dependencies": {
        "xunit": "2.2.0-beta2-build3300",
        "dotnet-test-xunit": "2.2.0-preview2-build1029"
    },
    "frameworks": {
        "netcoreapp1.0": {
            "dependencies": {
                "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
                    "type": "platform",
                    "version": "1.0.0"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note">
  You may have noticed that part of what we did here was mark your class library as a .NET Core Application
  (the <code>netcoreapp1.0</code> framework). When using .NET CLI for testing, unit test projects are actually
  an application<sup>*</sup>, not a class library. If you forget to make this change, the compiler will tell
  you that <code>dotnet-test-xunit</code> is not compatible with your class library project. We tell Visual
  Studio to generate a class library, though, because it most closely matches our desired project structure.<br />
  <br />
  <em><sup>*</sup> The application's <code>Main</code> function is provided by the xUnit.net runner, not by you.</em>
</div>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  When you created the project, Visual Studio automatically created a file named
  <code>Class1.cs</code> and opened it for you. Inside this class, add a couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Build the solution to ensure that the code compiles. Now that you've written the first
  test, we need a way to run it.
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests-console">Run tests from the console</h2>

<p>
  Open a command prompt or PowerShell command window. In the window, navigate to folder
  containing the source code of your test project (this will usually be in a folder below
  the <code>src</code> folder, in your solution folder).
</p>

<p>
  To run the .NET CLI test runner, type <code>dotnet test</code>, as shown below:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet test</span>
xUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit .NET Core win10-x64)
  Discovering: MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
  Starting:    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.FailingTest [FAIL]
      Assert.Equal() Failure
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      Stack Trace:
        C:\Samples\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\src\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\Class1.cs(16,0): at MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstDotNetCoreTests  Total: 2, Errors: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.167s
</pre>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more way to
  write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named <code>[Fact]</code>
  rather than one with a more traditional name like Test. xUnit.net includes support for
  two different major types of unit tests: facts and theories. When describing the
  difference between facts and theories, we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to test an algorithm
  which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're writing the positive-side tests
  (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers into the test would cause it fail, and not because
  the test or algorithm is wrong.
</p>

<p>Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we can see it fail):</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This time when we compile and run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:</p>

<pre>
xUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit .NET Core win10-x64)
  Discovering: MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
  Starting:    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(value: 6) [FAIL]
      Assert.True() Failure
      Expected: True
      Actual:   False
      Stack Trace:
        C:\Samples\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\src\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\Class1.cs(30,0): at MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(Int32 value)
    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.FailingTest [FAIL]
      Assert.Equal() Failure
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      Stack Trace:
        C:\Samples\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\src\MyFirstDotNetCoreTests\Class1.cs(16,0): at MyFirstDotNetCoreTests.Class1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstDotNetCoreTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstDotNetCoreTests  Total: 5, Errors: 0, Failed: 2, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.173s
</pre>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the console runner actually ran 5 tests;
  that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test. Note also that the runner
  tells you exactly which set of data failed, because it includes the parameter values in
  the name of the test.
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests-vs">Run tests in Visual Studio</h2>

<p>
  The same NuGet package which allows you to run tests from the console also allows you to
  run tests from within Visual Studio. Show the Test Explorer window by choosing
  <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>. The Test Explorer window will
  show inside Visual Studio, and your test should be visible (if they're not, try
  building your project to kick off the test discovery process). It should look something
  like this:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-dotnet-core/vs-runner-not-run.png" width="321" /></p>

<p>
  If you click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, it will run your
  tests and show you success and failure. You can click on an individual test result to
  get failure information as well as stack trace information:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-dotnet-core/vs-runner-tests-run.png" width="321" /></p>

<h2 id="adding-config-file">Adding a configuration file</h2>

<p>
  The .NET CLI runner supports <a href="configuring-with-json.html#dotnet-cli">JSON-based
  configuration files</a>. When using a configuration file with .NET CLI, you need to instruct
  the build system to copy the config file into the bin folder when it builds. To do this, add
  the following to the top-level of <code>project.json</code> file:
</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "buildOptions": {
        "copyToOutput": {
            "include": [ "xunit.runner.json" ]
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="targeting-desktop">Targeting desktop .NET</h2>

<p>
  The .NET CLI runner is capable of running tests which target desktop .NET (minimum version 4.5.1),
  in addition to .NET Core. To target desktop .NET, use this frameworks section instead:
</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "frameworks": {
        "net451": {
            "dependencies": {
                "Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms": "1.0.1"
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You can target both <code>net4xx</code> and <code>netcoreapp</code> simply by adding both frameworks
  together in your <code>project.json</code> file. When you run <code>dotnet test</code> with multiple
  framework entries, the system will run all your framework tests, one after another.
</p>

<h2 id="console-return-codes">Console runner return codes</h2>

<p>The following return codes are used by the console runner:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Return code</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">The tests ran successfully.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">One or more of the tests failed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>2</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      The help page was shown, either because it was requested, or because the user did not provide any
      command line arguments.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>3</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem with one of the command line options passed to the runner.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>4</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem loading one or more of the test assemblies (for example, if a 64-bit only assembly
      is run with the 32-bit test runner).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
